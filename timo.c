/*
 * trivial timeouts implementation.
 *
 * A timeout is used to schedule the call of a routine (the callback)
 * there is a global list of timeouts that is processed inside the
 * event loop ie mux_run(). Timeouts work as follows:
 *
 *	first the timo structure must be initialized with timo_set()
 *
 *	then the timeout is scheduled (only once) with timo_add()
 *
 *	if the timeout expires, the call-back is called; then it can
 *	be scheduled again if needed. It's OK to reschedule it again
 *	from the callback
 *
 *	the timeout can be aborted with timo_del(), it is OK to try to
 *	abort a timout that has expired
 *
